# Snyk Node (JavaScript) Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for using [Snyk](https://app.snyk.io/) for Source Composition Analysis and license identification. Results are uploaded to the Security tab of a given repository, leveraging the SARIF schema.

You can use the Action as follows:

```yaml
name: snyk-analysis
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push: 
    branches: [main]
    paths: [package.json]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  snyk-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Snyk Analysis
      uses: awshole/snyk-node@main
      with:
        snyk_api_key: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        path_to_dependency_file: package.json
        upload_sarif: true
        snyk_github_integration_token: ${{ github.token }}
        repository: ${{ github.repository }}
    - name: Upload SARIF file
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: ${{ github.workspace }}/snyk.sarif
```

The Snyk Node (JavaScript) Action has properties which are passed to the underlying shell executing custom scripts. These are
passed to the action using `with`.

## Reusable Workflow 
You can use the Action in the form of a re-usable workflow as follows:

```yaml
name: snyk-analysis-javascript 
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    paths: [package.json]
  pull_request:
    paths: [package.json]
jobs:     
  snyk-analysis:
    uses: awshole/snyk-node/.github/workflows/snyk-analysis.yaml@main
    with:
      path_to_dependency_file: package.json
    secrets: inherit
```
